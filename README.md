Terminal Related Commands

This simple C header file is useful for microcontrollers that happen to interface back to a computer through
terminal program such as Putty. This library allows for text font formatting and other useful terminal
related commands that can be used inside of printf() like functions.

This C coded library can be used in any application requiring a PID controller. No matter the platform (Arduino/AVR, PIC, MSP430, Kinetis, STM32, etc...), this library can be applied with absolutely no changing of the underlying implementation of the code. Include this library in any C/C++ project as needed.

All documentation for how to use the library can be found in the header file of the library.
